From scratch Deep Learning model for COVID patients classification

These files implement a Deep Learning classification model from scratch
using just Numpy with the intention to help people briefly get into DL stuffs
Codes are not optimized and that is the purpose of this repository.
We are still looking for tricks to improve our implementation.
Feel free to clone this repo and train the model with several configs and parrameters
If you want to be contibutor and help us scaling up this model or just can help with ideas,
techniques, algorithms....
Whatever that may help, please don't hesitate to reach us out and contact this email:
